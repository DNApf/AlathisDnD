## Biography

On a cold winter's eve the wood elf Llaina almost arrived home from attending a feast organized by the druidic Circle of the Land in [Ifa Dorei](../../Alathis/index.md#ifa-dorei), when suddenly she
perceived a faint weeping from afar. The weep didn't sound beastly, not like a wolf puppy nor like any other creature she knows. Llaina cautiously tracked down the origin of the noise and found a tiny
humanoid creature, tightly wrapped in blankets and sheepskin. The creature must have been a while in the cold, it was barely moving, freezing cold and the noise it made was more like a fainting whine
than a baby's cry. Without further ado, Llaina picked the bundle of blankets, fur and humanoid-something up and rushed home into a small and simple, yet warm and cozy lodge deep in the woods of [Peak
Side](../../Alathis/index.md#the-peak-side-woods). It was close to a miracle, that the baby wasn't already devoured by some beasts of the woods.

The lodge was empty when Llaina returned home. Her secret love Aemaer, a firbolg barbarian, was out hunting for food and making sure that no enemy creatures roam close by the lodge. Llaina quickly
grabbed some fresh blankets, carefully wrapped the baby in it and pulled it close while she sat down next to the fireplace. Just then she could have a close look at the creature. It was a female elf,
almost certainly a wood elf, just like herself, with a few copper red hair already showing on her head. She couldn't have been older than four to six weeks. The only thing with her was a small broach
in the shape of a feather with small green and white jewels, that held her old blankets together. Llaina soon noticed the baby finally warming up and her skin color slowly turning from bluey to rose.
Beautiful, bright blue eyes were staring right into Llaina's eyes. She fed the baby with goat milk and named her Fae. It was out of question for her whether to keep and raise the little baby. Luckily,
Aemaer was just as happy to welcome the new family member. They found something in her, they weren't looking for and finally made the young family complete.

Growing up in the peak side woods was not an easy task. Fae has spent a lot of time understanding and perfecting the ways and laws of nature. Like her adoptive mom she has begun to perfect the ways of
the druid and like her adoptive father she has taken to the quieter side of life. Her life is quiet other than a few run ins with the occasional beastly fight at her door, otherwise life is what one
would expect of a lifetime in the woods.

While exploring the woods, she came across an injured Wolf one day. She learned about the spell "Speak with Animals" recently and made her first effort on the wolf. She fed him and treated him back to
health while figuring out where he came from and where his family lived. What started as a conversation of little trust became a true friendship. As her visits became more frequent the wolf introduced
her to the pack. They welcomed her, show her their ways and treat her as kin. For this reason Fae is an expert in nature techniques such as tracking, hunting, and gathering.

A month before Fae's new adventures started, her rather quiet and peaceful life has suddenly turned. Fae was awoken by the clashing of swords seeing her adoptive parents battling with hooded figures.
The figures disappeared into a cloud of smoke, badly injured before Fae could reach them, and her parents breathed deep with looks of concern. As she approached them, she heard a voice in her head,
“they have found you, you cant stay here. For your safety …and theirs. Take to the world, find yourself, and when you are ready, come find me. I'll be waiting, and stay safe, they’ll always look for
you.” The next day Fae said goodbye to her parents and set out to find herself and the owner of this mysterious voice. She had traveled across the land using her knowledge of nature to survive.

Fae traveled a month like this and it finally was time for some interaction with civilization. After all how do you find a voice if you don’t talk to people, she wondered. Her first stop was a small
tavern in the town of Dimbrook off the shore of the [Soaring Coast](../../Alathis/index.md#soaring-coast).
