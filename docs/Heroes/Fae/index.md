## Biography

- abandoned by biological parents at birth in the deep winter of peak side woods near an inhabitated lodge

- found, raised and adopted by the lodge inhabitants: a female druid wood elf Llaina and a male firbolg Aemaer, who fell in love with each other after Aemaer leaped through a portal and escaped from his society

- adoptive mother Llaina is part of the druidic circle of the land but keeps her love relationship a secret

- Fae grew up in the rough nature, befriended with wolves and other creatures and soon chose to be a druid to study nature, balance, animals and herbalism

- she rarely had friends and, unlike other elves, loves using crude and vulgar language
